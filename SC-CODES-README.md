##Steps for Week 8
* Setup GitHub.com account
* Setup a Cloud9 account
* Start thinking about ideas for open/public data you'd like to gather and share with the world.

###Ideally, this is will be data that:
* already publicly available but is locked inside of a map, PDF, or web page
* does not change frequently
* is not something Google Maps already does well
* is not tiny
* is not huge

Things like Greenville restaurants or Greenville malls would not be ideal.

##Steps for Week 9
* Decide on which project you want to use
* Go to https://github.com/codeforgreenville/leaflet-google-sheets-template
* Go to the top right corner and click Fork
* GitHub will create a fork (your own personal copy) with yourusername/leaflet-google-sheets-template
* Once the fork is created, click Settings. Under the "Repository name" setting, give a new name to your map layer.
* For example yourusername/leaflet-google-sheets-dog-parks
