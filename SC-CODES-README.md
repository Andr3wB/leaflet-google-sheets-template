#Steps for Week 8
* Setup a Cloud9 account using the invite from Pamela
* Connect your GitHub account to Cloud9 (via Connected Services)[https://c9.io/account/services]
* Start thinking about ideas for open/public data you'd like to gather and share with the world.

###Ideally, the data set should:
* already publicly available and not easily portable (i.e. part of a PDF, web page, or Google Map)
* consist of latitude, longitude "point data" (shapes or paths will be too advanced and not directly work with the base code)
* not frequently changing
* not be something Google Maps already does well
* not be very tiny or too huge to be practical to render in a map or to maintain
* be something you could help maintain even after SC Code wraps up
* be specific to Greenville city, Greenville county, or the Upstate
* be complete (try to avoid picking something if you can't get close to listing all / most of the possible points)

Non-profits, the City, and the County would be ideal examples of places to find existing data. In other cases, you may need to do the research / leg work to 

For instance, (the City has a map of parking decks)[http://www.greenvillesc.gov/513/Parking] but the data is stuck inside of their map. You can't easily take that data and layer more data on top within your own map.

Things like Greenville restaurants or stores would be an example of a less desirable data set because it changes frequently, is hard to maintain, and Google Maps already does it well enough for most purposes.


###Map Layer Guidance

The list below are more along the lines of what's expected. You're welcome to
claim this idea by putting your name in the (open data spreadsheet)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWsFT1p0ZY-DInfMOFq_gmqpGuKyl5wyBb9VoyoEjRs/edit#gid=30878412]

* Historic Sites
* Parks
* Parking Decks
* Community Gardens
* Waterfalls
* Trail Parking
* Bike Racks
* Danger Zones along trails
* City and County Recycling locations
* City and County Trash / Convenience Centers
* Dog Parks
* Tree Planting Sites

#Steps for Week 9
* Decide on which project you want to use
* Go to https://github.com/codeforgreenville/leaflet-google-sheets-template
* Go to the top right corner and click Fork
* GitHub will create a fork (your own personal copy) with yourusername/leaflet-google-sheets-template
* Once the fork is created, click Settings. Under the "Repository name" setting, give a new name to your map layer.
* For example yourusername/leaflet-google-sheets-dog-parks
